# About me

- Cookies are yum.
- Pixel art is also yum.
- Certified nerd.
- Constantly finding new things that interest me. I keep a list of topics that I plan to explore, and the speed with which it grows terrifies me. 
- The more I know, the less I know. The less I know, the more I crave to know. And when I seek that knowledge, I discover more that I do not know. Trapped I am in this endless cycle.
- The [indie web](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb) thingy sounds so cool... but... it looks so hard to set up?!?! 
- I love art and music. I love lore-heavy video games with deep meanings and realistic characters. When will I be able to make such a game myself?
