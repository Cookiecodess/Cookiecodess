# About me

- Obviously, I quite fancy cookies. Delicious things, they are.
- I also love pixel art.
- Certified nerd.
- Constantly finding new things that interest me. I keep a list of topics that I plan to explore, and the speed with which it grows is terrifying. My short attention span isn't helping either.
- An advocate for the open web! Always so inspired by all the awesome people who work hard to make the web -- and the tech space in general -- open and accessible to all.
- Love art but I'm just not nearly as creative as people like louie zong ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/everydaylouie)) and jack stauber ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/jackstauber)). Thankfully I'm got pretty decent analytical skills, so I'll be honing my coding skills and try to incorporate my creativity and aesthetic sense into my programming projects!
- I struggle to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.
